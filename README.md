<B>An Early Start: A Day of Reflection and Celebration at GURU NANAK DEV ENGINEERIN COLLEGE</B><br>

<B>Arrival and Gurudwara Hall</B><br>

The crisp morning air of an early start, 9 AM to be exact, marked the beginning of a special day at the First Aid College. It was not just a regular day of lectures and practicals, but one steeped in tradition and celebration as the college commemorated its 70th Jubilee. The journey to the campus was filled with a sense of anticipation, knowing that the day held a unique blend of spiritual solace, academic inspiration, and celebratory spirit.
Upon entering the college premises, the first stop for everyone was the Gurudwara Hall. The atmosphere inside was one of serene reverence. The chanting of religious hymns filled the space, and the path, a sacred prayer, was recited. This spiritual beginning underscored the holistic approach to education at the college, recognizing the importance of nurturing both mind and soul. Gurudwaras play a vital role in Indian society and culture, serving as centers of community life and fostering values of equality and service. Many also establish educational initiatives to empower the community.<br>

<B>Tea and snacks break</B><br>

After the tranquil experience at the Gurudwara Hall, the college had thoughtfully arranged a tea and snacks break from 10:30 AM to 10:45 AM. This provided a moment for students to relax, interact, and refuel before the next part of the day's events. Such thoughtful gestures, beyond the academic schedule, contribute to a sense of community and well-being among students.<br>

The highlight of the day was the gathering in the college auditorium. Here, the teachers and the Principal took the stage, not merely as educators but as mentors and guides. Their addresses were not just about academic excellence, but also a source of motivation and encouragement, reminding the students of the dedication, hard work, and values that embody the spirit of the institution. The occasion was further amplified by the celebration of the college's 70th Jubilee. This milestone served as a powerful reminder of the college's long-standing commitment to education and its legacy of shaping futures. A jubilee, whether golden, diamond, or platinum, is a significant event for any institution, offering an opportunity to reflect on past achievements and set new goals for the future.<br>

The day concluded around 3:30 PM, leaving a lasting impression of inspiration and pride in the hearts of the students. The combination of spiritual reflection at the Gurudwara, the warmth of shared refreshments, and the motivational words of the faculty, all woven into the grand celebration of the 70th Jubilee, created a truly memorable day. It reinforced not only the importance of academic pursuits but also the values of community, tradition, and the enduring legacy of the Guru Nanak Dev engineering College.<br>
